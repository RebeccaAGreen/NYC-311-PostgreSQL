---Analysis 1 Which complaint types take the longest to close?
with CTE_data as(
select category, extract(day from age(closed_date,created_date)) as closing_days
from nyc_311_2018
where status='Closed'
union all

---Analysis 2 Are certain agencies consistently slower in closing tickets?

---Analysis 3 Does location type effect the avg closing time?
with cte_locationtype as(

from nyc_311_2018
where closed_date is not null and status='Closed' and locationtype is not null

 ---Analysis 4 Does the time of day a complaint is submitted impact how fast it is resolved?
with cte_hour as

 when time_of_day='Afternoon'then 2
 when time_of_day='Evening' then 3

 end;



 ---Analysis 5 Does closing time vary based on complaint submission method? (Phone, web, mobile app?)

with cte_source as
(select source,
extract(day from age(closed_date,created_date)) as closing_days
from nyc_311_2018
